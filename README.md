# MerakPhecda
A research project based on Purple star

# Introduction and the paper

The project used China Biographical Database Project as its main source to unveil the institutional fundenmental settings during the Song dynasty empirically. The main idea is based on a previous research to use network ananlysis and machine learning algorithms to find the deciding factors of the social status, proxided by official rank, of the people in Song dynasty. 

The paper was presented on 10th International Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities (DADH 2019) in Taiwan. 

If you use the data or codes in a scientific publication, we would appreciate citations to the following paper:

@inproceedings{SongOfficialRankAndNetwork,

  author    = {Lin Ma and Monica Li},
  
  title     = {WHAT HELPED OFFICIALS OF SONG DYNASTY IN CLIMBING THE GREASY POLE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY},
  
  eventtitle = {10th International Conference of Digital Archives and Digital Humanities},
  
  year      = {2019},
  
}

# How to use the codes and data:

#### Firstly, download "edgelist.zip" and unzip it. 

#### Then, run "ReadSQLdbAndCreateEdgelistForEveryTenYears***.ipynb" The filenames indicate the type of tests. The code will produce splited csv data for each decade. 

#### At last, run "Regression_and_random_forest***.ipynb" to reach the results. 

Additional tests are provided in folder "Additional tests".

# If you have questions

The data and codes are not supposed to be used by end-users, but are provided as resources for other scholars with proper background knowledge. We would like to provide, but cannot guarantee, explanations to scholars who want to understand the conference paper while already have basic knowledge in Python with pandas. Also, offers for cooperative research are welcomed. Please provide information about you and your institution along with your questions. Thank you very much.
